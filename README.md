Objective of this project was to detect crop disease (in my case Apple) using image processing by scannig leaves.

Made use of Convalution Neural Network and Tensorflow is used to build the model

Architecture used made from scartch based on VGG16

trained on 100 epochs for 5 hrs appox

Training Accuracy 81%

Validation Accuracy 75%

loss 3.2
